    "# Approach\n",
    "## Modularization\n",
    "Break into many transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Module 1: Patient samples viral load -> RT-LAMP molecules -> PCR molecules -> Gets pooled into sequencing\n",
    "- Module 2: Sequencing reads -> thresholded to produce binary output\n",
    "- Module 3: Binary output (0 or 1 for each barcode) -> Naive decoder for k' out of k. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initial focus is on last two modules, modeling the first module requires experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module 2 Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, molecules to be sequenced are modeled as:\n",
    "- having amplified initial viral titer loads, log normal distribution with mean = 4.5, std = 3\n",
    "- having saturating amplification functions, normalizing initial viral titer loads, normal distribution with mean 10000, std 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "To go from post-PCR molecules to binary output:\n",
    "- Fractional abundance for each barcode calculated by dividing by total number of molecules for a subbatch is computed\n",
    "- If fractional abundance for a barcode * total good reads per subbatch > threshold, 1. Otherwise, 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## To Do\n",
    "- Characterize real transformations for module 1 (experimentally)\n",
    "- Implement possibility for some people to have extra barcodes/less than expected due to liquid handling error\n",
    "- Build a heatmap for FNPs/FPPs dependent on parameters for distribution of post-PCR molecules (mean, std)"
