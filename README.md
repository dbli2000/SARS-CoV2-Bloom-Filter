# SARS-CoV2-Bloom-Filter
Scripts for simulating and plotting an approach for population-scale SARS-CoV2 testing, accompanying preprint. 
Most model details are in Supplementary Note 1 (PDF available in repo).

Files:
- SARSCoV2barcoding.ipynb contains numerical simulations for skewing errors across samples due to viral titer load.
- SARS_CoV2_Scalable_Testing_Simulations_v3.m contains code for making all of the figures in the text and in Supplementary Note 3.
